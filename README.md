The domain used by Toby Smith to host his side-projects, things, and bits!

This repository contains a small landing-page-style website which is hosted on the root domain.

# Building

The website in this repository doesn't have a build stage, it's only static content.

The package.json should still be installed to ensure that the developer tools like Prettier are set up properly.

The dependencies listed in the package.json are also needed for the e2e tests.
